                <p>As a researcher in HCI and ML, my interdisciplinary background in computer science, design, and education has been crucial. During my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I immersed myself in computer vision, algorithms, and global challenges like Topcoder. I continued my education with a post-graduation in Innovation &amp; Experience Design, which gave me valuable insights as an independent designer from 2008-2015. As a faculty member at the Srishti Manipal Institute from 2017-2022, I taught mathematics, algorithms, and human-computer interaction while contributing to the ReRide project and publishing research papers. I co-facilitated the Experimental Maths Lab, which fostered interdisciplinary learning, drawing from my evolving course offerings in programming, human-computer interaction, design, and mathematics.</p>
<p>I believe that seeking help and support is a sign of strength, not weakness. As such, I am dedicated to creating a judgment-free environment where students can discuss their concerns, interests, and ideas. Collaboration and peer support are essential for navigating the academic journey and fostering personal growth and resilience. Students can benefit greatly from guidance, educational support services, and counseling by connecting with educators. I encourage students to do so. Setting realistic goals, celebrating achievements, and practicing self-compassion are all essential components of my approach to student success. By reaching out for guidance and assistance, students can develop innovative solutions, expand their understanding, and confidently face the challenges that lie ahead. I always welcome students to reach out to me for help and support.</p>
<h2>Suggested communication</h2>
<ol>
<li>Introduce yourself and briefly explain your academic background, research interests, and what you hope to achieve by connecting with me.</li>
<li>Highlight specific areas where you seek guidance, support, or feedback. This could include questions related to, but not limited to coursework, research projects or career advice.</li>
</ol>
