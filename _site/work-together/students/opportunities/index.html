                <p>My passion for computer science, machine learning, and human-computer interaction is rooted in my interest in applying these principles to real-world engineering problems. I specialize in developing optimal graph drawing algorithms and high-performance visualization tools for large datasets while promoting algorithmic explainability for transparency and accountability. My research also explores graph theory &amp; algorithms in the natural world and the complex relationship between humans and computers, particularly AI and interaction design. I am committed to advocating for ethical considerations in the development and use of technology, including open-access knowledge, archiving, and accessibility beyond the Internet. To address the emerging themes in computer science, machine learning, and human-computer interaction, my research aims to bridge the gap between diverse fields and promote interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>With my background in computer science and design, I have a reasonably deep understanding of computation, programming paradigms, and human-centered thinking. I have a keen interest in recreational mathematics and pedagogy, which underscores my commitment to creating engaging learning environments that incorporate fun and thought-provoking mathematical activities. As a former faculty member at Srishti Manipal Institute, I taught mathematics, algorithms, and HCI while co-facilitating the Experimental Maths Lab to bridge design with theoretical CS and math. Through my mentorship, I have helped students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and I am eager to extend my guidance and expertise to more students. From time to time, I offer project opportunities where students can apply their knowledge and work with me as their mentor to gain practical experience and tackle real-world problems.</p>
<h2>Current opportunities</h2>
<p>There are no projects that I am currently offering. Please check back later. However, I'm keen on re-offering <a href="/notes/2020/deconstructing-algorithms/">Deconstructing Algorithms</a> in the future. If you're interested in this project, please get in touch with me.</p>
<h2>Suggested communication</h2>
