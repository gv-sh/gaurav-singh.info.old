<p>In 2012, I encountered a period of slowing down as I transitioned from completing my 4-year engineering program in Computer Science to discovering the design field. The year was filled with uncertainties as I navigated unplanned, embracing challenges and opportunities for personal development. Shortly after concluding my engineering studies, I relocated to Chennai. I wasn't bothered about getting a job; just keen on furthering my education and expanding.</p>
<p>Although my engineering career wasn't filled with any special achievements, it did give me some essential skills that I knew would be helpful to me in the future. As I went deeper into the design field, I began to appreciate the diverse possibilities that awaited me in this field. I looked forward to exploring them further as I continued to grow and learn.</p>
<p>When exploring graduate options, I realized a Master's degree in my undergraduate field wouldn't provide the intellectual breadth I sought. I decided to explore design, hoping for a more engaging study environment. After researching design schools in India, I chose to take the CEED (National design entrance exam) as my first step.</p>
<p>My initial CEED attempt was not good enough, but I decided to retry it next year. I spent the year exploring design schools in India, refining my goals, and making sense of what I wanted to do ahead. By year-end, I had a better view and was eager to start with further studies, with knowledge and experiences from the past years. This journey taught me the importance of resilience.</p>
