                <p>This is with reference to the David Kelley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517154229/http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/8-kelley.html">interview transcript</a> given to us to read and summarise.​ I have never thought of the differences between engineers and ​designers in the way David Kelley explained while being interviewed by Bradley Hartfield. The major difference lies in the approach designers and other practitioners adopt to a given problem. The designers often by considering the large number of factors like “Who is going to use this product?”, “Will they like it?”, “Will it be really suitable?”.. the list goes on. The fact is, this makes designer’s work really a mess. On the other hand, the engineers don’t like to submerge them into these factors, and they just develop a solution by applying the systematic methodology that they had learnt back in their college. On a concluding note, a designer believes in intuition and creates solution by unconscious learning whereas engineers never even believe that intuition exists. In my perspective, engineers and designers indeed are two different things but there is a existence of intersection where a good engineer is a designer as well and vice-versa.</p>
