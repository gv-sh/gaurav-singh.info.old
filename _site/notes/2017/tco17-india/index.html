<p>Topcoder design workshop at Srishti Institute of Art, Design &amp; Technology, Bangalore on 17 Aug 2017</p>
<p>Topcoder has arrived in the city for their India Regional event and their inaugural design workshop in India. It is with great pleasure that I inform you that Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology had the honor of hosting Topcoder's first-ever design workshop in India. The workshop was open to all Srishti students pursuing the Human-Centered Design discipline. The participants were surprised by the two Rapid UX challenges announced by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adroc/">Adam Morehead</a>, Creative Head of Topcoder, as they had not been provided much detail about Topcoder or the workshop beforehand. The time constraints of RUX and their limited experience in designing interfaces left the students feeling challenged. However, Adam and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshitmehta15">Harshit Mehta</a> (Topcoder Evangelist) did a remarkable job of engaging with the students and clearly discussing the future of design. During his presentation, Adam introduced cognitive design and its significance for designers. The RUX winners were rewarded with cash prizes, which certainly made them happier and demonstrated Topcoder's appreciation for their participation.</p>
<p>Adam provided feedback for all the RUX submissions, which will help students to appreciate the different perspectives and to articulate their decision-making while designing. In a nutshell — an engaging workshop for all of us. Adam and Harshit also invited everyone to take part in the regional event.</p>

<p>TCO17 India venue: CoWrks space at RMZ EcoWorld, Bangalore</p>
<p>Afterward, we attended the Regional Event held at the CoWrks space at RMZ EcoWorld, where over 200 Topcoder members from across the country and beyond gathered in the vast space for a thrilling experience. I was fortunate enough to meet some of the prolific members of Topcoder Studio for the first time, including ravijune, systic, teevics, rajeshrathod, talesforce, and many others.</p>

<p>The event started with a talk by Adam on Cognitive Design, followed by brief presentations from Digital Ocean and Amazon about their products. The challenges were then announced, and I was excited to meet my fellow studio members and compete in the RUX challenge, which focused on future infotainment systems and cognitive design. The challenge lasted for five hours.</p>
