<p>&gt; What if information about a rider’s condition such as body posture, lean angles, heart-rate, etc., were made available as part of the ride experience?</p>
<p>The following story is a glimpse into our ongoing research through designing a platform to explore, design, and in-situ test ideas for interactions with personal data around motorcycle riding.</p>
<p>What if information about a rider’s condition such as body posture, lean angles, and heartrate, were made available as part of the ride experience? A glimpse into our ongoing research into designing a platform to explore, design, and in-situ test ideas for interactions with personal data around motorcycle riding. In collaboration with the Digital Design Department at the IT University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&gt; The motorcycle could soon be the new frontier for the exploration of human interaction with advanced digital technology. In this paper we present a demo of a system designed and implemented as platform exploring the design of personal informatics tools for motorbike commuting and help us conduct in-situ evaluation of such tools. We present the system architecture and demonstrate the capabilities of the system by presenting a case instantiation in the form of an interactive soft-and- hardware prototype that collects rider’s posture data, visualizes the data on the motorbike dashboard in real-time, and pushes the data to the cloud server for later retrieval. (Excerpt from the demo paper we submitted for Interact 2017 conference)</p>
<p>This project is continuation of original ReRide design experiment started by Dr. Naveen Bagalkot and Suraj Baadkar at Srishti Institute of Art, Design &amp; Technology, Bangalore in collaboration with Tomas Sokoler at the Digital Design Department at the IT University of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of months, we have put together a working prototype of ReRide. The prototype reads the rider’s posture through multiple sensor points and displays ‘glanceable’ feedback in the dashboard area of the bike, and stores this information in a remote server for later access.</p>
<p>We are demoing ReRide at Interact 2017 Conference in IIT Bombay from 27–29th September 2017.</p>

<p>We see our work on ReRide as an invitation to Personal Informatics and HCI community to further explore the challenging, yet under-explored frontier of interacting with computation as part of motorbike commuting.</p>
