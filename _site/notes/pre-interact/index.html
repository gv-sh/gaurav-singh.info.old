                <p>&gt; What if information about a rider’s condition such as body posture, lean angles, heart-rate, etc., were made available as part of the ride experience?</p>

<p>What if information about a rider’s condition such as body posture, lean angles, and heartrate, were made available as part of the ride experience? A glimpse into our ongoing research into designing a platform to explore, design, and in-situ test ideas for interactions with personal data around motorcycle riding. In collaboration with the Digital Design Department at the IT University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&gt; The motorcycle could soon be the new frontier for the exploration of human interaction with advanced digital technology. In this paper we present a demo of a system designed and implemented as platform exploring the design of personal informatics tools for motorbike commuting and help us conduct in-situ evaluation of such tools. We present the system architecture and demonstrate the capabilities of the system by presenting a case instantiation in the form of an interactive soft-and- hardware prototype that collects rider’s posture data, visualizes the data on the motorbike dashboard in real-time, and pushes the data to the cloud server for later retrieval. (Excerpt from the demo paper we submitted for Interact 2017 conference)</p>
<p>This project is continuation of original ReRide design experiment started by Dr. Naveen Bagalkot and Suraj Baadkar at Srishti Institute of Art, Design &amp; Technology, Bangalore in collaboration with Tomas Sokoler at the Digital Design Department at the IT University of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of months, we have put together a working prototype of ReRide. The prototype reads the rider’s posture through multiple sensor points and displays ‘glanceable’ feedback in the dashboard area of the bike, and stores this information in a remote server for later access.</p>
<p>We are demoing ReRide at Interact 2017 Conference in IIT Bombay from 27–29th September 2017.</p>

<p>We see our work on ReRide as an invitation to Personal Informatics and HCI community to further explore the challenging, yet under-explored frontier of interacting with computation as part of motorbike commuting.</p>

<p>System Architecture</p>

<p>One of the early visualisation (also shown in the video above). We later revised this visualisation after initial feedback. The system architecture for the platform is made up of several individual components.</p>

<p>First Prototype: An input sensor, such as a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) is attached to a Genuino microcontroller with embedded Bluetooth capability, and an nternet connected smart phone make up the environmental sensing device. Data collected during the ride is pushed to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT Cloud Platform, which does all the message relaying and cloud computing. This Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) has much different functionality required to store, process and evaluate the data sent to it. Any Internet-connected client device can connect to the PaaS and subscribe to or pull information from a custom generated API, which can be visualized over either a browser or a native application.</p>

<p>Sketching to visualise sensor data — to understand and design a appropriate way to display the feedback to the rider in various scenarios.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.mathscapes.xyz/static/images/2017/wor_5.jpg"/>
<p>This tiny chipset is Redbear BLE Nano, which we are using to send accelerometer and push button data to Android phone. This essentially works on Bluetooth Low Energy which means it can run on a coin cell without needing to charge for long durations.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.mathscapes.xyz/static/images/2017/wor_6.jpg"/>
<p>This is the primary sensing unit — consists of two force sensitive resistors (FSRs) connected to Genuino 101 board which is capable to sending the sensor data through Bluetooth. The sensors from this unit will be concealed under the seat and get the data of rider’s sitting balance which is key in lower back pain.</p>
