<p class="caption">The village of Chintalayyagarepalle</p>
<p>In 2015, during the final year of my postgraduate studies at Srishti, I engaged with the thesis work. This two-fold project involved an investigation of Chintalayyagarepalle, a remote off-grid village, and exploring piezoelectric materials, specifically Rochelle salt. The project allowed me to comprehend the challenges communities face in off-grid situations and learn about the potential of sustainable energy solutions. However, as I navigated through this undertaking, I found mixed feelings regarding my overall experiences throughout the program. Throughout the year, I sensed the positive and negative aspects of my academic journey. Disappointment and frustration arose from the insufficient representation of our work at the grad show, while the program's lateral exploration left me longing for a deeper understanding of specific subjects. Nevertheless, I acknowledged the importance of continuous reflection, adaptation to new situations, and pursuing growth in areas that piqued my interest.</p>
<p>As the year progressed, I sought ways to apply my knowledge and skills in practical settings, hoping to find fulfilment in my academic goals. This led to a collaborative initiative with my friend Prakhar, where we attempted to teach Processing to Srishti students. Although the momentum disappeared over time, the experience added practical insights into collaboration and the potential for growth through shared experiences. 2015 emerged as a year of challenges. As I completed my postgraduate journey at Srishti, I embraced the combination of experiences, both positive and challenging, that shaped my academic course. Moving forward, I am determined to pursue growth and opportunities that resonate with my interests while learning from the challenges encountered during my final year. I am eager to plan further.</p>
