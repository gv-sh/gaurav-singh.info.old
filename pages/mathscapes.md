In 2000, I began to learn about computers, leading me to develop an interest in mathematics and computer science. My curiosity grew over the years, and in 2006, I started contemplating the idea of a small research group. Eventually, in 2008, I started imagining Mathscapes. Mathscapes aims to facilitate and share ideas in mathematics while exploring the connections between natural science, humans, and computing. At Mathscapes, we work on open-source tools and resources to make math more approachable and engaging for everyone. We study algorithms, considering not just their efficiency but also their complexity and impact on humans and nature. We constantly reflect on the consequences of advancing technology for society.

Initially sustained by personal funds, Mathscapes received a grant from the Adobe Fund for Design in 2021. We're now looking for like-minded individuals and organizations to collaborate with us on this path. We're open to commissioned work, joint projects, and guiding students interested in mathematics, algorithms, and technology. As Mathscapes evolves, we stay true to our core values of humility, curiosity, and ethical practices. We embrace complexity, provide context, design for failure, and encourage open-source collaboration. We aim to create a more inclusive and accessible future for everyone who appreciates the potential of mathematics to explore the world around us.
