From the early 2000s, I developed a curiosity for computers, which gradually developed into an interest in mathematics and computer science by 2000. Over time, this interest grew, leading me to contemplate the idea of starting a small research group while still in school in 2006. In 2008, I identified my interest in prime numbers and their potential use in information compression. I began experimenting with algorithms that employed prime numbers for information compression. Although theoretically valid, I soon realized that these algorithms were impractical for real-world use. This realization allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the complex nature of algorithm design and the importance of considering practical implications alongside theoretical possibilities. It also prompted me to start imagining Mathscapes in the same year, with the goal of facilitating and sharing ideas in mathematics while exploring its connections with natural science, humans, and computing. I wish to keep Mathscapes in stealth as much as possible and only bring it to more people very slowly over the years. My aim is to develop open-source tools and resources to make math more approachable and engaging for everyone, while remaining mindful of the potential impact of my research on society as a whole. At Mathscapes, I work and aspire to work further on algorithms, taking into account not only their efficiency but also their complexity and impact on humans and nature. I remain constantly mindful of the consequences of advancing technology for society.

\> “Abstraction consists essentially in the creation and utilization of ambiguity.” \[…\] “Logic moves in one direction, the direction of clarity, coherence, and structure. Ambiguity moves in the other direction, that of fluidity, openness, and release. Mathematics moves back and forth between these two poles. \[…\] It is the interaction between these different aspects that gives mathematics its power.” — William Byers (How Mathematicians Think, Princeton University Press, 2007) [1]

I believe mathematics is a universal language that can capture and model the processes around us. It is the foundation for abstraction, logic, and the most potent language to decode and design. The power of mathematics lies in the interaction between different aspects of ambiguity and clarity, fluidity, and structure. I am committed to promoting accessibility and engagement in mathematics and inspiring future generations of mathematicians and computer scientists. My research agenda involves developing optimal algorithms using rigorous mathematical principles and exploring the intersection of mathematics and computing to create new algorithms that can solve complex problems innovatively. I recognize the need for ongoing collaboration with experts in related fields, including natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences. The future of algorithm design involves creating efficient, practical, innovative, ethical, and responsible algorithms that can process large amounts of data in real time. My research includes developing new tools and resources to make mathematics more approachable and engaging for everyone. I am committed to constantly exploring further research questions and developing innovative solutions. Mathematics is essential for algorithm design and is at the core of technological progress and improving our understanding of the world. At Mathscapes, I remain open to new ideas and collaborations to expand the boundaries of algorithm design and its impact on society.

At Mathscapes, our goal will also be to explore the long-term implications of technology on society and address the ethical implications of technological advancements. We seek to create innovative solutions to mitigate potential harm and improve our lives while avoiding unintended consequences. We will focus on developing ethical and responsible algorithms to process large amounts of data in real-time while collaborating with experts in related fields to create comprehensive solutions to complex problems. As we push the boundaries of algorithm design and optimization, we will recognize the need for ongoing reflection and dialogue about the implications of technological advancements on society and the environment. Mathscapes' long-term vision involves a better understanding of the complex relationships between mathematics, technology, and culture. We will also inspire future generations of mathematicians, designers, computer scientists, and technology leaders committed to ethical and responsible innovation.
