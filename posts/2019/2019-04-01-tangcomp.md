Privacy in ATM<br/>
Ishita Begani, Shalini, Saksham<br/>
Have you ever stood in line of an ATM only to discover that all the money is over or only Rs.2000 notes are available? Or you see people peaking into your business unnecessarily while you just want to do a simple transaction? Our solution tackles both of these problems with an automatic enclosure and a visual indicator to show the denominations available in the ATM. The enclosure will get activated at the point during the experience where the user gives out any sensitive information. The visual indicator will show the levels of denominations in the ATM at that point of time and will change after each withdrawal. Our solution caters to the two most important themes that came up in our research â€“ Privacy and Efficiency. In our current Prototype we've only addressed the Privacy Issue with a Flap that comes out every time Sensitive information is exchanged between the ATM and the user.
