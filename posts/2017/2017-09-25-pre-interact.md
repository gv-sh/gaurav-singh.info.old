\> What if information about a rider’s condition such as body posture, lean angles, heart-rate, etc., were made available as part of the ride experience?

The following story is a glimpse into our ongoing research through designing a platform to explore, design, and in-situ test ideas for interactions with personal data around motorcycle riding.

What if information about a rider’s condition such as body posture, lean angles, and heartrate, were made available as part of the ride experience? A glimpse into our ongoing research into designing a platform to explore, design, and in-situ test ideas for interactions with personal data around motorcycle riding. In collaboration with the Digital Design Department at the IT University of Copenhagen.

\> The motorcycle could soon be the new frontier for the exploration of human interaction with advanced digital technology. In this paper we present a demo of a system designed and implemented as platform exploring the design of personal informatics tools for motorbike commuting and help us conduct in-situ evaluation of such tools. We present the system architecture and demonstrate the capabilities of the system by presenting a case instantiation in the form of an interactive soft-and- hardware prototype that collects rider’s posture data, visualizes the data on the motorbike dashboard in real-time, and pushes the data to the cloud server for later retrieval. (Excerpt from the demo paper we submitted for Interact 2017 conference)

This project is continuation of original ReRide design experiment started by Dr. Naveen Bagalkot and Suraj Baadkar at Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology, Bangalore in collaboration with Tomas Sokoler at the Digital Design Department at the IT University of Copenhagen.

Over the last couple of months, we have put together a working prototype of ReRide. The prototype reads the rider’s posture through multiple sensor points and displays ‘glanceable’ feedback in the dashboard area of the bike, and stores this information in a remote server for later access.

We are demoing ReRide at Interact 2017 Conference in IIT Bombay from 27–29th September 2017.

We see our work on ReRide as an invitation to Personal Informatics and HCI community to further explore the challenging, yet under-explored frontier of interacting with computation as part of motorbike commuting.
