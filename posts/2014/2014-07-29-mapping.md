[Tahireh Lal](http://tahireh.com) is an accomplished Indian artist whose reflexive practice explores the dynamic interplay between movement and stasis. Her work draws on local contexts and materials to investigate the complex themes of time and home, finding expression in various mediums such as video, installation, and sculpture. In her masterclass on Mapping our lives, Tahireh challenged participants to create a work connected to their own lives using a set of given materials.

The masterclass began with a captivating demonstration by Tahireh of her mapping of life through a series of lemonade shots. Each shot had a distinct flavor that evoked a specific memory associated with a particular place or time in her life. As the participants sipped on the lemonade, Tahireh shared stories and anecdotes that provided a unique insight into her life experiences. The demonstration set the tone for the rest of the workshop, emphasizing the importance of personal reflection and introspection in art.

The Mapping our lives workshop was a challenging yet stimulating experience that encouraged participants to explore new ideas and concepts. The use of specific materials and the time constraint forced participants to think creatively and outside the box. Tahireh's guidance and expertise helped participants navigate this challenge by encouraging them to experiment and explore their unique perspectives.

Throughout the workshop, Tahireh emphasized the importance of having a strong idea and executing it effectively. She demonstrated how a strong concept could be expressed through the effective use of materials and highlighted the need for constructive feedback to improve one's work. By encouraging participants to share their work and providing constructive criticism, Tahireh created a supportive environment that allowed everyone to learn from each other's ideas and techniques.

The Mapping of Our Lives masterclass underscored the importance of personal reflection and introspection in the creative process. Tahireh's unique demonstration of mapping her life through the flavors of lemonade posed critical questions about the role of sensory memory in evoking powerful emotions and connections to our own life experiences. The workshop also highlighted the value of creative experimentation and effective execution in expressing ideas and experiences.
