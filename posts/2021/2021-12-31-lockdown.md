Looking back at 2021, it felt like a very slow year due to the ongoing pandemic. Despite this, I offered two courses that gave students unique learning opportunities. The Explain with GIFs project allowed students to explore using GIFs to simplify complex algorithms and make information more accessible to a broader audience. In contrast, the Sketch, Crit, and Remix workshop encouraged participants to take a step back from their individual inquiries and think about how to carry out inquiries related to digital and technology. I also noted that I had more time to structure and plan for Mathscapes, which was a positive outcome.

2021 was a year of challenges and slow progress, but I made the most of it by reorienting and preparing myself to focus on my long-term goals.
